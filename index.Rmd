Hey!

I'm Mike Page, a data scientist at [cynkra](https://www.cynkra.com/). Previously,
I've worked at the British Red Cross building tools such as the
[COVID-19 Vulnerability Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability)
and [Resilience Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index),
which aimed to help the charity find those most in need. I also build open source
tools for the broader voluntary and community sector that make data science easier,
such as the[humaniverse](https://github.com/humaniverse) suite of R packages and
[Shiny Panda](https://github.com/MikeJohnPage/shiny-panda). 

Outside of work I like to mountain bike, climb, snowboard, and surf. And write
silly R packages like [mortyr](https://github.com/mikejohnpage/mortyr).

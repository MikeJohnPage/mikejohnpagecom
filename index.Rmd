Hey!

I'm Mike Page, Data Scientist at the British Red Cross. Here, I mainly 
build tools such as the [COVID-19 Vulnerability Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability)
and [Resilience Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index),
which aim to help find those most in need. I also build open source tools for
the charity and voluntary sector that make data science easier, such as the
[humaniverse](https://github.com/humaniverse) suite of R packages and
[Shiny Panda](https://github.com/MikeJohnPage/shiny-panda). 

Outside of work I like to mountain bike, climb, snowboard, and surf. And write
silly R packages like [mortyr](https://github.com/mikejohnpage/mortyr).

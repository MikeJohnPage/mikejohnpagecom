Hey! I'm Mike Page, Data Scientist at the British Red Cross. I build tools to
help find those most in need, such as the [COVID-19 Vulnerability Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability)
and [Resilience Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index).
I also build open source tools for the charity and voluntary sector that make
data science easier, such as the [humaniverse](https://github.com/humaniverse)
suite of R packages and [Shiny Panda](https://github.com/MikeJohnPage/shiny-panda). 

Outside of work I like to mountain bike, climb, snowboard, and surf.
